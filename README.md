# Sims Status Bars

Simple React webapp that displays status bars similar to those in the Sims series. You can specify what bars you'd like to create, and include the rate at which they progress.

### Goals:
- Allow users to pick from a variety of icons for custom bars.
- Make it easier to specify the tick time of bars (for example, do a task x times a day).
- Turn the webapp into a mobile app using React Native.
- Allow user logins to save their status bars.
- Update UI to be cleaner, possibly with Material-UI.
